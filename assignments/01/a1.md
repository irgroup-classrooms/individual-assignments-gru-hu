# Assignment 01
Create a new markdown file and edit the file with the browser interface. Alternatively, you can clone it, then commit changes, and push them (more about this in two weeks).
Add a to do list with things you have heard about today and would like to learn throughout the semester. You can update this list during the semester by checking things you have learned.
Add a table that documents the markdown syntax, which you can use as your personal cheat sheet throughout the semester.
Add a quote (about data science or sth. more general) that inspires you.
Add verbatim code. With a code snippet that is already familiar to you. Alternatively, write Python code that prints "Hello World!".
Add three other markdown-formatted contents. Also insert headings with appropriate levels.
